                               cherryloan.co.uk does not engage in collection practices. Your lender will contact you by e-mail, telephone, or regular post to describe and arrange your payment schedule. Please contact your lender to discuss their collection process, as lender collection policies vary.

                              If you feel you will be unable to make a timely loan repayment, please contact your lender directly. The lender might be able to extend or renew your loan in accordance with the original loan terms. Late payment terms and options vary by lender.

                              If you are unable to make your payments on time, your lender may begin the collection process in accordance with the loan terms. Often, your lender will contact you to arrange for an alternative repayment schedule, which may result in additional fees or interest. Lenders may additionally initiate legal proceedings to effectuate repayment. Consider contacting your lender before you miss a payment to learn more about their collection policy and discuss your repayment options.

Although some lenders may offer you a loan renewal on the same terms as your original loan, each lender’s renewal policy is different, and renewals might incur additional fees or interest. Under certain circumstances, renewals may be automatic. Please weigh the decision to renew an existing loan heavily, and consider consulting with independent financial counsel before renewing your loan. <br>
