                                    The Company is a credit broker, and facilitates the connection of consumers interested in loan amounts between £100 and £5,000 with participating Lenders (the "Company's Services"). The Company is not a
                                    Lender or a loan provider, does not make loans or credit decisions, and does not provide financing directly to you. The Company is a free referral service through which interested consumers can connect
                                    with a network of independent, third party Lenders. The Company is not an agent of any particular Lender, and the Site is not an offer or solicitation to lend. Any compensation the Company may receive is
                                    paid by the Lender for advertising services provided. By completing and submitting a registration form on the Site, you give your consent to be matched with a Lender in our network. <br />

                                    The Company will present your Information to one or more of our Lenders based on their individualised criteria until such time as a Lender accepts your application, or your application is declined by all
                                    Lenders your Information is presented to. Upon acceptance, you will be redirected to the Lender’s website to complete the application process. You are under no obligation to accept the terms of a loan
                                    offer before signing any applicable loan documents with the Lender, and you may cancel the process at any time before such point. Read the terms of any loan offer carefully and consider obtaining
                                    independent legal and/or financial advice before accepting. <br />

                                    transmission to the Lender. All loan terms are those of the Lender alone. The Lender is solely responsible for its services to you and your interactions with the Lender are subject to such Lender's terms,
                                    conditions and privacy policies. Please direct all questions, comments, or concerns involving your loan to the Lender. <br />

                                    payment schedule. An offer extended by a Lender is not a guarantee by any party that such offer is suitable for your financial needs. It is your responsibility to ensure that any products or services
                                    available on the Site or through the registration form meet your individual needs.

                                    Although Company does not check your credit profile, make credit decisions, or determine loan terms, our Lenders routinely use credit referencing agencies (“CRAs”) and/or fraud prevention companies to
